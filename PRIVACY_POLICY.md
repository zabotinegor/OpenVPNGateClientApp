## Privacy Policy
This privacy policy applies to the Client for OpenVPN Gate app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Yahor Zabotsin (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

## Information Collection and Use
The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include information such as:
- Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)
- The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages
- The time spent on the Application
- The operating system you use on your mobile device

The Application does not collect precise GPS coordinates of your mobile device.

The Application may derive your **approximate** location from your public IP address (country/region only). No GPS or coarse/fine location sensors are used. Approximate IP-based location is used in the following ways:
- **Geolocation Services:** To provide basic country-level content and recommendations.
- **Analytics and Improvements:** Aggregated and anonymized, to analyze trends and improve performance.
- **Third-Party Services:** Anonymized IP-based location may be sent to external services to enhance the Application and optimize offerings.

## VPN Service and BIND_VPN_SERVICE Permission
The Application uses Android's VPNService (which requires the BIND_VPN_SERVICE permission) solely to create a secure VPN tunnel to the OpenVPN Gate servers that you explicitly choose. Traffic is routed through the VPN tunnel only while you are connected, and the Application does not inspect, store, or sell your traffic; packets are forwarded only to maintain the VPN session.

The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions.

For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that the Service Provider request will be retained by them and used as described in this privacy policy.

## Third Party Access
Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.
