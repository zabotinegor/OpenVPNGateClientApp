# Known Issues and Solutions

This runbook collects non-obvious problems and their solutions discovered during development and
QA. Add an entry only when the issue is likely to recur and the fix is not obvious from the
error message alone.

## WorkManager unit tests: `AlarmManager.setExact()` not available in Robolectric 4.10.2

**Symptom**

Using `WorkManagerTestInitHelper.initializeTestWorkManager(context)` in unit tests under
Robolectric 4.10.2 causes a crash:

```
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: AlarmManager.setExact() not mocked
```

The `WorkManagerTestInitHelper` internally uses `AlarmManager.setExact()`, which is not
available in the Robolectric shadow layer at version 4.10.2.

**Affected tests**

Any `CoroutineWorker` or `OneTimeWorkRequest` unit test that uses
`WorkManagerTestInitHelper.initializeTestWorkManager()`.

**Solution**

Do not use `WorkManagerTestInitHelper` in unit tests. Instead, test the `CoroutineWorker`
`doWork()` method directly by constructing the worker with a fake or in-process
`WorkerParameters` object, and verify return values (`Result.success()`, `Result.retry()`,
`Result.failure()`) without enqueuing through WorkManager.

For deduplication / enqueue policy behaviour, inject a thin `OneTimeWorkEnqueuer` abstraction
and stub it in tests. This is the same pattern used in `ServerRefreshSchedulerTest`.

**First encountered**

SUB-02 (`ProbeRequestWorkerTest`). Fixed by testing `doWork()` directly on a constructed
`ProbeRequestWorker` instance rather than through the WorkManager API.

## `MainActivitySmokeTest` failures: `NoActivityResumedException` on real device

**Symptom**

All (or most) cases in `MainActivitySmokeTest` fail with `NoActivityResumedException` when run
via `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTestApp`. The activity never resumes within the Espresso
timeout window.

**Root cause**

`ActivityScenario` in `MainActivitySmokeTest` launches `MainActivity` directly, bypassing
`SplashActivity`. The production `MainActivity` assumes that `SplashActivity` has already
completed its server-preload network calls (managed via `SplashServerPreloadInteractor`). When
those OkHttp calls are absent, the Espresso `OkHttpIdlingResource` never becomes idle, causing
the test runner to time out before the activity enters a resumed state.

**Affected device**

Confirmed on Samsung Galaxy A71 SM-A715F, Android 13 (ADB serial R58N849XQEY). Fails
identically on `dev` branch without any feature-branch changes, confirming it is a pre-existing
issue.

**Workaround**

For manual smoke verification, always launch the app through `SplashActivity`:

```bash
adb shell am start -n com.yahorzabotsin.openvpnclientgate/.mobile.SplashActivity
```

Do not rely on `MainActivitySmokeTest` as a CI gate until the test is refactored to either:
- mock the network layer and OkHttp idling resource, or
- launch `SplashActivity` as the entry point and navigate forward from there.

**First confirmed**

SUB-02 docs cycle (2026-06-15). Same failure reproduced on `dev` branch (7/7 cases).

## Adding a new OkHttp3 test artifact: `mockwebserver` not found in version catalog

**Symptom**

Attempting to add `testImplementation("com.squareup.okhttp3:mockwebserver:...")` as a bare
coordinate fails to resolve the correct version, or the artifact is absent from
`libs.versions.toml`, causing a version-catalog lint error:

```
Could not find libs.okhttp.mockwebserver
```

**Root cause**

The version catalog (`src/gradle/libs.versions.toml`) contained `square-okhttp` as a version
reference for the runtime `okhttp` library but had no catalog alias for the companion
`mockwebserver` artifact.

**Solution**

Add an entry to `[libraries]` in `src/gradle/libs.versions.toml` using the existing
`square-okhttp` version reference so both artifacts stay in lock-step:

```toml
okhttp-mockwebserver = { group = "com.squareup.okhttp3", name = "mockwebserver", version.ref = "square-okhttp" }
```

Then declare the dependency in the module's `build.gradle.kts` as test-only:

```kotlin
testImplementation(libs.okhttp.mockwebserver)
```

This keeps the MockWebServer version identical to the OkHttp runtime version without duplicating
the version number.

**First encountered**

SUB-03 (`HardProbeApiClientTest`).

## Gradle daemon OOM on machines with ≤ 16 GB RAM: heap reduced from 4096m to 2048m

**Symptom**

Gradle daemon crashes with an `OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` (or the build process is
killed by the OS) on a development machine with 11 GB RAM when `org.gradle.jvmargs` is set to
`-Xmx4096m`.

**Root cause**

The default heap ceiling in `src/gradle.properties` was `-Xmx4096m`. On machines where the OS
and other processes already consume a significant portion of available RAM, the Gradle daemon
cannot allocate a contiguous 4 GB heap, causing OOM failures or excessive GC pauses.

**Solution**

Reduce the heap in `src/gradle.properties`:

```properties
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
```

`2048m` is sufficient for a full debug build and all unit tests on the project as of SUB-03.

**CI note**

If CI runners provide more than 8 GB RAM and need faster incremental builds, override via the
`GRADLE_OPTS` environment variable in the CI workflow rather than changing
`gradle.properties`:

```yaml
env:
  GRADLE_OPTS: "-Xmx4096m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"
```

This keeps the committed default safe for low-memory machines while giving CI full headroom.

**First encountered**

SUB-03 (2026-06-16) on Samsung developer workstation with 11 GB RAM.

**References**

- `src/gradle.properties` (line 8)
