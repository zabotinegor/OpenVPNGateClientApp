These Terms govern your use of the **Client for OpenVPN Gate** (“Application”). By installing or using the Application, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Application.

## 1. What the Application Does
- Provides a client that connects to VPN servers you select, including the public VPN Gate network or other endpoints you configure.
- Routes your traffic through the chosen VPN server only while connected. The Application does not inspect, store, or sell your traffic.
- Does not operate, control, or guarantee the availability, security, or policies of any VPN server (including VPN Gate nodes run by third parties).

## 2. Acceptable Use
- You are solely responsible for how you use the Application and for the legality of your activities and traffic in your jurisdiction.
- Do not use the Application for unlawful activities, rights infringement, abuse, malware distribution, or bypassing restrictions where prohibited by law or applicable terms of service.
- You are responsible for securing your device, credentials, and network configuration.

## 3. No Service Guarantees
- The Application is provided “AS IS” without uptime, quality, or fitness guarantees. Connectivity may fail, be slow, blocked, or unavailable.
- Server lists may change, be inaccurate, or unavailable. We do not promise that any server will work for any purpose.

## 4. Third-Party Services
- VPN Gate and any other VPN servers you use are operated by third parties. Their policies and behavior are outside our control.
- The Application may call external services (e.g., for IP info) as documented in the Privacy Policy.

## 5. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Application is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”, without warranties of any kind (express, implied, or statutory), including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or reliability of connectivity.
- We are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, including data loss, service interruption, or legal consequences arising from your use of the Application or any third-party server.

## 6. Indemnity
- You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the developer (Yahor Zabotsin) from claims arising out of your use of the Application or violation of these Terms.

## 7. Changes
